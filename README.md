### Project Title:
**Predicting E-Cigarette Smoking (Vaping) Trends Using CDC 2017 BRFSS Data**

### Project Description:
**Background**

E-cigarette (vaping) usage continues to rise in the United States (U.S.), creating public health concerns due to potential respiratory effects and associated behaviors in alcohol use. As the tobacco industry has evolved over time, e-cigarette smoking, or vaping, has become a popular alternative to conventional smoking. This rise in popularity for vaping has encouraged researchers to conduct studies to examine the vaping rates as well as the health conditions and illnesses believed to have arisen from it. According to the results of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2016-2018, e-cigarette use has been on the rise from 4.5% in 2016 to 5.4% in 2018 with 2017 being a mostly stable year at 4.4% (Obisesan et al., 2020). In one particular study, researchers surveyed asthmatics who vaped and non-asthmatics who transitioned from smoking to vaping and found the transition to have no effect on pulmonary function tests (Solinas et al., 2020). Yet another study examining the state of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) in a life-long tobacco smoker who switched to e-cigarettes found the patient’s case of asthma to be triggered by irritants found in vape liquid (Roberts et al., 2021). It is imperative to gain further knowledge and understanding on the effects of vaping to support the conclusions from past research or discover new insights. The results of this study will help support efforts in executing public health interventions in communities most impacted by asthma, along with partnerships and health guidance.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a vested interest in this research to gain further knowledge and understanding of tobacco product trends. Specifically within the CDC, the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) organizes efforts to intervene through prevention techniques, aid for those who want to quit, and methods of reducing exposure to secondhand smoke. As this study is targeted towards adult asthmatics, the National Asthma Control Program (NACP) will also be informed since it aims to combat the chronic health condition through research that leads to interventions and treatment options offered asthmatic communities.

**Question**

“Can we predict e-cigarette smoking (vaping) of tobacco and marijuana among United States adult asthmatics in 2017 after accounting for demographics, conventional smoking status, and alcohol usage?”

**Hypotheses**
1. Adult asthmatics who vape will be more likely to be past smokers because advertisers promoted vaping as a healthier alternative to smoking in the years leading up to 2017.
2. Adult asthmatics who vape are more likely to engage in other risky lifestyle choices, like high alcohol consumption because individuals can have multiple addictions, or they may have lifestyles in which they do these activities together.

**Predictions**
1. We predict that vaping will be relatively higher among adult asthmatics who smoke or have a history of smoking as compared to those who do not smoke tobacco cigarettes.

### Project Goals:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Perform data cleaning and pre-processing steps
- Perform feature engineering using PCA and K-Means clustering
- Prepare the data for supervised and unsupervised modeling techniques
- Discover the best model for addressing the research question
