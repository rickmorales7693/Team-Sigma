### Preliminary Project Title:
**Analyzing E-Cigarette and Vaping Trends Using CDC 2017 BRFSS Data**

### Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the rising usage of e-cigarettes and vaping among adults in the United States using the CDC’s 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Prior research shows that e-cigarette use increased from 4.5% in 2016 to 5.4% in 2018, with 2017 being a relatively stable year at 4.4% (Obisesan et al., 2020). Our primary research question is: Does certain health information—such as asthma status, age, sex, general health status, and alcohol use—influence e-cigarette or vaping status among the American adult population? This question aims to support public awareness and inform public health agencies like the CDC’s National Asthma Control Program (NACP), which funds local and state health departments. By better understanding these trends, the CDC can improve its community-level interventions and guidance.

We hypothesize that adults with asthma are more likely to use e-cigarettes or vape compared to those without asthma, and that individuals who vape are more likely to consume alcohol regularly. Our first prediction is that there will be a strong association between asthma and vaping, possibly because some individuals may see vaping as a safer alternative to smoking. The second prediction is that vaping may be linked to other risk behaviors, such as weekly or frequent alcohol consumption, and potentially transitioning to conventional cigarette smoking. Using statistical and machine learning models, we aim to test these hypotheses and evaluate whether these predictors are meaningful indicators of smoking/vaping behavior in 2017.
